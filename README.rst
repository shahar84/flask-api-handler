Flask API handler
=================

A small wrapper for a Flask app to simplify endpoints creation

Motivation
----------

At my company, we’ve been using Flask-RESTful for a lot of projects for
the past couple of years, and when we mapped exactly what we need from
it, it was mostly the way it allows the user to add routing.

This small module replace for us this functionality, so I’ve decided to
share it with whoever want to give it a try :wink:

Getting Started
---------------

This wrapper helps davide the Flask App into modules and to use
**Classes** instead of functions for views.

Just run pip install and you are good to go: instructions

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install flask-api-handler

Prerequisites
-------------

The only requirement for this project is Flask.

Usage
-----

.. code:: python

    from flask import Flask
    from flask import jsonify
    from flask_api_handler import ApiHandler

    form example import PaymentHandler

    app = Flask(__name__)

    # Init the api handler 
    api = ApiHandler(app)

    class UserHandler(object):
        def get(self):
            return jsonify({"user": "user object example"})
        def put(self):
            return jsonify({"user": "update user example"})

    # Add the endpoints 
    api.add_handler('/user', UserHandler)
    api.add_handler('/payment', PaymentHandler)

TODO
----

-  [STRIKEOUT:Make pip installable] - DONE
